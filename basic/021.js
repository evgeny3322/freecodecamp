// Quoting Strings with Single Quotes
// String values in JavaScript may be written with single or double quotes, as long as you start and end with the same type of quote. Unlike some other programming languages, single and double quotes work the same in JavaScript.
//
//     const doubleQuoteStr = "This is a string";
// const singleQuoteStr = 'This is also a string';
// The reason why you might want to use one type of quote over the other is if you want to use both in a string. This might happen if you want to save a conversation in a string and have the conversation in quotes. Another use for it would be saving an <a> tag with various attributes in quotes, all within a string.


var myStr = '<a href="http://www.example.com" target="_blank">Link</a>';
